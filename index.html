      <p>
        Welcome to the PolyAxis political alignment quiz. It's intended to assess one's political leanings
        along Left/Right, Authoritarian/Libertarian, Pragmatist/Idealist, and Populist/Elitist axes. I know
        there are a lot of answer choices, but I really wanted to make sure they captured more of the nuance
        that exists when people (or at least I) approach questions like these. Normally there is one neutral
        option, but I wanted to distinguish between a 'true neutral' and someone who both agrees as well aside
        disagrees with the statement. Choosing the 'unsure' option will mean your answer to the question is not counted
        for determining alignment along that specific axis.

        Disclaimer: I am not a political science expert or even much of an amateur really, I'm just a
        data-minded science nerd who can stitch together some Frankenstein code. That means you should
        take these results for what they are: fun and interesting; they are not necessarily meaningful
        in any deeper sense so interpret at your own risk. <br><br>
